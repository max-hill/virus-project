# Bootscan Readme
This folder contains the results of our bootscan analysis on the dataset set1c
(BHV5, 216\_II, C33, C46, Cooper, Titanium, K22, B589, SP1777). This analysis
was performed using RDP4.101 (Recombination Detection Program, available
[here](http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~darren/rdp.html). 

The folder `window800-step100/` contains the results when bootscan was performed
in manual mode with the default settings, except for window size and step size,
which were set to 800bp and 100bp respectively. Under those settings, the plots
were made using libreoffice calc, see the files `all-bootscan-plots.ods` and
`all-bootscan-plots.pdf` contained in that folder.
