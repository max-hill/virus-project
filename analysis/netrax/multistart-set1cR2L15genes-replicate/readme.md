# Instructions for setting up this experiment

This experiment was run in a similar manner to the experiment in the folder
`analysis/multistart-set1cL2R15genes-replicate/` but with "L2R" everywhere
replaced by "R2L". See the readme in that folder for more detailed instructions.

The experiments are run using the script `runL2R15.sh`. Detailed instructions
for the script (especially on a remote server) can be found as comments in the
script itself.

When the run has finished, we copy the output from `scripts/NetRAX/` to the
experiment folder (i.e. this folder) manually.
