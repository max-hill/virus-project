# Instructions for setting up this experiment

This experiment was run in a similar manner to the experiment in the folder
`analysis/multistart-set1cL2R15genes/` and the readme in that folder may be
useful as it contains more details. We are just replicating that experiment
here, so to install NetRAX and set up the experimental directories, follow the
instructions theres.

# Instructions for running the experiment
The experiments are run similarly to the experiment for 97 genes in the L2R
case, i.e. using the script `runL2R15.sh`. Detailed instructions for the script
(especially on a remote server) can be found as comments in the script itself.

When the run has finished, we copy the output from `scripts/NetRAX/` to the
experiment folder (i.e. this folder) manually.
